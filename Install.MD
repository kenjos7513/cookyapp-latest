## Installation


Before anything else, make sure you have php installed in your environment and ngrok for tunneling the url for react native consumption. Download XAMPP for php development environment. 

Download the 'cookyapp-backend-laravel.zip' zip file and extract the content to a specific folder.
Create 'cookyapp' database as found in the .env file.


Run first the composer install to install vendor packages

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

After running migration make sure to run seeder to create two users with different roles(basic user and admin)

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Make sure to symlink too the storage in order to be available in public

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

Then run now the laravel application
```bash
php artisan serve
```

After running the laravel application run now the ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```


Copy the url generated by the ngrok e.g https://0014-175-176-95-14.ngrok-free.app and paste it in the cooky app react native application in app/config/apiConfig.ts file and replace the apiGateway.URL path

## Running the react native app


After doing above steps, install dependencies for React Native Application

```bash
yarn install
```

Make sure to run this in order to be able to use internal downloaded fonts

```bash
npx react-native-asset
```


After doing above steps, then run the react native android app, but make sure to connect emulator or physical android device first before doing it.


Run this command first to make sure to clean gradle cache but make sure to run it in './android' directory

```bash
gradlew clean
```

Now run this one

```bash
yarn android
```

The login credentials for admin and basic user are:
admin@gmail.com - testpassword12345
basicUser@gmail.com - testpassword12345
